        'Aero road bikes are optimized to cut down on wind resistance by using more aerodynamically shaped tubing for the frame, along with wheels, handlebars and other elements that are likewise designed specifically to knife through the wind, and brakes that are sometimes placed behind other elements of the bike, out of direct air flow, etc. Aero bikes look very much like a typical “racing” type road bike, but they have been wind tunnel tested to reduce drag – and thus increase potential speed with no additional effort.

        'Similar to a touring bike, a bikepacking (think, backpacking) bike is set up and accessorized to enable the carrying of gear – in this case, for camping in areas that can be reached via bike. Frame materials, wheels and tires, gearing – pretty much all facets of the bike – will be focused on robustness and stability carrying a load, not on weight and speed. Steel, sturdy and long-lasting',

        'For those who commute to work or school and still want the efficiency and speed of a road bike, some choose an older and/or more robustly set up road bike to handle the daily grind. Especially if weather and the elements are factors, something less than a “high end” bike is usually preferred, since it’s likely to collect a bit more dirt, be punished a bit more, etc',

        'Cyclocross is an “off-season” (usually fall) sport where racers navigate mostly off-road short courses that feature an array of riding surfaces, terrain and obstacles. The surfaces may include mud, sand, dirt and pavement. The terrain can, and usually does, include some testy steep hills, possibly water that must be traversed, and the obstacles can include logs or jumps that must be crossed, among others.',

      description:
        'Dual-Sport bikes are, effectively, hybrid bikes for riders wanting to do more with the bike than with a typical hybrid. In short, they may want to ride a little faster or more aggressively. These bikes feature the same basic components of a hybrid bike, but set up in a way to allow dual-purpose riding. They still have a flat, fairly upright handlebar, just not as upright as regular hybrid bikes.',
